Faith Must Be Tested to Become Power

> “Ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith.”
—Ether 12:6



Faith will always be tested:

By time

By silence

By opposition

By discomfort

By discouragement


But this testing isn’t punishment—it is the process of transformation.

Faith Leads to Witness — Witness Builds Testimony — Testimony Feeds More Faith

Faith initiates a divine cycle:

1. You act in faith


2. You receive spiritual witness


3. That witness strengthens your testimony


4. Your testimony fuels deeper faith


5. Deeper faith unlocks greater action


6. Greater action brings greater witness
…and the cycle continues



This is how power accumulates.
This is how Saints become unshakable.

Final Thought

Faith is not weakness.
It is not wishful thinking.
It is alignment with unseen truth—trusting the system before you see the fruit.

Faith is the reason the system turns on.
And once it is alive in you…
You never walk alone again

REPENTANCE — THE SYSTEM OF REPROGRAMMING**

Definition

Repentance is not guilt management.
It is not a cycle of shame.
Repentance is the divinely designed process of spiritual reprogramming—where fallen behaviors are surrendered, broken patterns are rewritten, and the will is re-aligned to God.

It is not just about turning from sin.
It is about turning into structure.

Repentance Is a Law, Not an Emotion

> “Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.”
—Luke 13:3



Repentance is not optional for sinners—it is required for everyone.
Why? Because all mortals are programmed by:

Pride

Fear

Flesh

Trauma

Culture

The natural man


Repentance is the only way to erase corruption and install divine operating systems.

The Five Elements of Repentance

1. Recognition

You identify the misalignment

You feel the dissonance between your spirit and your behavior



2. Remorse

You grieve the disconnect—not just out of guilt, but because you desire harmony with God



3. Realignment

You confess, forsake, and recalibrate

You replace the old pattern with the Lord’s pattern



4. Restitution

Where possible, you restore what was damaged—spiritually, emotionally, or physically



5. Repetition

You repeat the correction until the new pattern becomes permanent




This is not a formula—it is a spiritual engineering system.

Repentance Is the Engine of Ongoing Growth

Repentance doesn’t end once you’re baptized.
It becomes your lifestyle.

> “Repentance is not a backup plan. It is the plan.”
—President Russell M. Nelson



Why?

Because:

We are continually misaligning

We are continually refining

And God uses repentance to shape us into something holy

Repentance Is Joyful

> “My soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!”
—Alma 36:20



Repentance brings:

Light

Relief

Clarity

Energy

Flow of the Spirit

Peace


Satan says repentance is a burden.
Christ says repentance is the doorway to transformation.


---

Final Thought

Repentance is not a punishment.
It is not a time-out.
It is a sacred invitation to change—to be rewired, reformed, and realigned with God’s nature.

You are not just avoiding hell.
You are becoming someone heaven can trust.

And it starts the moment you choose to submit to the system—again.


**CHAPTER 4

BAPTISM — THE LAW OF COVENANTAL ENTRY**

Definition

Baptism is not a ritual.
It is not a cultural tradition.
It is the legal gateway into the gospel system—the moment where personal faith is sealed into heavenly contract.

Baptism is the first binding covenant.
It is where belief becomes structure.


---

Baptism Is an Ordinance of Entry

> “Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.”
—John 3:5



The gospel is not accessed by sincerity alone.
It requires legal spiritual entry.

Baptism is that moment.

It is:

A witness to God

A submission to Christ

A cleansing of sin

A spiritual rebirth

A contractual commitment to keep His commandments

Baptism Is Not Just Symbolic — It’s Transformative

It is symbolic and literal:
